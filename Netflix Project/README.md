Project Name :- üé¨ Netflix Data Analysis 

This project uses a real Netflix dataset to perform Data Analysis using Python. 
The goal is to answer key business questions using popular Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
This is a perfect beginner project for those starting out in Data Analytics with Python.

üìå Project Overview
In this project:-
Cleaned and explored the Netflix dataset
Answered real-world questions using Python code
Created visualizations to better understand trends
Learned how to manipulate and analyze time, text, and categorical data

--  Libraries and Commands Used --
head(), tail(), shape, size, columns, dtypes, info()
value_counts(), unique(), nunique(), duplicated(), isnull(), dropna()
isin(), str.contains(), str.split(), to_datetime(), groupby()

Time Series & Filtering
df['Date'].dt.year, dt.year.value_counts(), Filtering with AND / OR

Seaborn & Matplotlib for Visualization
sns.countplot(), plt.show()

‚úÖ Key Tasks 
Data Cleaning

Task 1: Check and remove duplicate records
Task 2: Check for null values and visualize them with a heatmap
