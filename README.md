This Project weather dataset is a time-series dataset that provides hourly data on weather conditions at a specific location. It includes key metrics such as temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, atmospheric pressure, and overall weather conditions.
These tasks were performed to clean, process, and analyse the weather dataset, providing insights into the weather conditions and variables.

1.	Find all unique values of 'Wind Speed': Identify and list all the distinct values present in the 'Wind Speed' column.
2.	Count the number of occurrences when the 'Weather' condition is exactly "Clear": Determine how many times the weather condition is classified as "Clear".
3.	Count the number of occurrences when the 'Wind Speed' is exactly 4 km/h: Identify how many instances there are when the wind speed was exactly 4 km/h.
4.	Identify all Null values in the dataset: Find and report all missing or Null values across the dataset.
5.	Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition': Change the name of the 'Weather' column to 'Weather Condition' for better clarity.
6.	Calculate the mean of 'Visibility': Find the average value of the 'Visibility' column.
7.	Calculate the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure': Calculate the standard deviation for the 'Pressure' column to understand the variability in pressure data.

📈 Outcome
This project provides a quick and clean way to explore weather data. It's a useful starting point for:
Weather trend analysis
Time-series forecasting
Climate-related projects

Project 2 

Project Name : London Housing Data Analysis
This project analyzes the London Housing Dataset using Python.

Import and clean real-world data
Use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
Extract insights through data grouping, filtering, and aggregation

📚 What’s Inside This Project?
✅ Questions Solved in This Project
Convert 'Date' column to Date-Time format
→ So we can extract year/month from it later.

Create new columns: 'year' and 'month'
→ Helps analyze housing data over time.

Remove 'year' and 'month' columns
→ Clean up the dataset after use.

Find records where 'No. of Crimes' is 0
→ And count how many such records exist.

Find the maximum & minimum 'average_price' per year in England
→ Understand how prices changed over time.

Find maximum & minimum 'No. of Crimes' recorded per area
→ See which areas were safest or most affected.

Show how many records (per area) have average price < 100000
→ Identify low-price zones.
