This Project weather dataset is a time-series dataset that provides hourly data on weather conditions at a specific location. It includes key metrics such as temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, atmospheric pressure, and overall weather conditions.
These tasks were performed to clean, process, and analyse the weather dataset, providing insights into the weather conditions and variables.

1.	Find all unique values of 'Wind Speed': Identify and list all the distinct values present in the 'Wind Speed' column.
2.	Count the number of occurrences when the 'Weather' condition is exactly "Clear": Determine how many times the weather condition is classified as "Clear".
3.	Count the number of occurrences when the 'Wind Speed' is exactly 4 km/h: Identify how many instances there are when the wind speed was exactly 4 km/h.
4.	Identify all Null values in the dataset: Find and report all missing or Null values across the dataset.
5.	Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition': Change the name of the 'Weather' column to 'Weather Condition' for better clarity.
6.	Calculate the mean of 'Visibility': Find the average value of the 'Visibility' column.
7.	Calculate the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure': Calculate the standard deviation for the 'Pressure' column to understand the variability in pressure data.

📈 Outcome
This project provides a quick and clean way to explore weather data. It's a useful starting point for:
Weather trend analysis
Time-series forecasting
Climate-related projects
